\section{Poisson distribution}

# overflow caused by the factorial in the traditional way for large k
underflow? caused by exponent of small number
# TODO: why do the results for the last two values differ? seems like the exponent gives a large round off error

The script for question 1 is given by:
\lstinputlisting{1_poisson_distribution.py}

The results are given by:
